# ## 2. Time for some Network of Thrones
# </p>As a result we can by the above code we can observe that Dataset <b>book1</b> has 5 columns:<br/><b>Source</b><br/><b>Target</b><br/><b>Type</b><br/><b>weight</b><br/><b>book</b> <br/>Here <b>Source</b> and <b>target</b> are the two nodes that are linked by an edge. A network can have directed or undirected edges and in this network all the edges are undirected. The weight attribute of every edge tells us the number of interactions that the characters have had over the book, and the book column tells us the book number.
# So here to create some network we are going to use <b>networkx</b>. Itâ€™s a network analysis library.<p/>

# ## 8. Correlation between different measures
# <p>Till now We have seen three different measures to calculate the importance of a node in a network, and all of them tells us something about the characters and their importance in the co-occurrence network.</p>
# <p>Let's look at the correlation between PageRank, betweenness centrality, Weighted degree and degree centrality for the fifth book using Pearson correlation.</p><br/>
# 
# <p><b>what is pearson correlation?<b/><p/><p>It Compute degree assortativity of graph. Assortativity measures the similarity of connections in the graph with respect to the node degree. <p/>

# In[77]:


#https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerank.html
# Creating a list of pagerank, betweenness centrality, degree centrality
# of all the characters in the fifth book.

            nx.degree_centrality(books[4])]

# Creating the correlation DataFrame
cor = pd.DataFrame.from_records(measures)

# Calculating the correlation
cor.T.corr() # remember to transpose the dataframe, otherwise the correlation between characters will be computed. 


# ## 9. Conclusion.
# <p>We have seen three different measures to calculate the importance of a node in a network, and all of them tells us something about the characters and their importance in the co-occurrence network. We see some names pop up in all three measures so maybe there is a strong correlation between them?</p>
# <p>Let's look at the correlation between PageRank, betweenness centrality, weighted degree and degree centrality for the fifth book using Pearson correlation.</p>

# according to degree centrality, betweenness centrality, eigen vector and pagerank.
